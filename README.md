jsonlrpc
========

A [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) library for Zig that implements TCP-based communication using [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format.


Acknowledgments
========
This project's architecture was inspired by [sile/jsonlrpc](https://github.com/sile/jsonlrpc), a Rust implementation of JSON-RPC over TCP using JSON Lines format.
While this Zig implementation is written from scratch, the overall design patterns and approach were influenced by the Rust version.
